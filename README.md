## Make Change Project

### Description
This is a simple program that takes a user input for the cost of an item,
then takes user input for the tendered.

The program will then print the exact change due followed by the bills and coins
the user should get back.


### Topics and Technologies Used

* Conditionals (if/else)
* Looping (while loops)
* Scanner
* Math.Round
* casting

### How to Run

Paste the code into a text editor capable of reading java.
Save the file
Run the class

### Lessons Learned
Using while loops inside of while loops followed by if statements can lead to
a lot of headaches.

I learned how to keep a good running count inside of MANY different loops and then output only the count for each of the variables it was used for.

After the project was almost completed I learned how to use math.round which could have
changed my approach.
